When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is very useful if you are working on a shared (colaborative) project or if you are using multiple machines to access the project (for example at work and at home).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Always pulling changes manually allows you to control when the commits are logical and working. Otherwise your work could clobber a working version or you would have to constantly create new branches. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are for tangential/exploratory work. Clones allow the use of github for multiple users and machines. Forks relate projects to each other within github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Retaining a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows you to compare changes made locally with those made somewhere else or by someone else.
