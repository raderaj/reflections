When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is very useful if you are working on a shared (colaborative) project or if you are using multiple machines to access the project (for example at work and at home).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Always pulling changes manually allows you to control when the commits are logical and working. Otherwise your work could clobber a working version or you would have to constantly create new branches.
